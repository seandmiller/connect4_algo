## A computer Algorithm for connect four
>I originally built this game on my phone as a beginner python programmer but I looked back on that source code with shame, 
>as it took up atleast 602 lines of code on my phone (roughly 380-400 on a pc) I had to make a much sophisticated version,
>so here we are. I just need to create an algorithm to determine the winner and im finished with this project
## Version 1.0.2
>Created the necessary computer algorithm to solve the connect four puzzle (almost finished), when it comes to figuring out who won the game
>going to need to figure out how to detect the winner diagonally, which is the true test for sure.

## Version 1.1.2 
>Minor tweaks to algorithm, getting rid of unneccessary over engineered code.

## Version 1.1.5
> Bug in algorithm needed to be fixed (fixed)
## Version 2.1.5
# Algorithm Complete
> Diagonal win 'solved' must stress test for future bugs, this was a fun project, however not so proud of my code, going to have to trim down in the future and make it more efficient
