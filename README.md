# Connect four
## Version 1.0.2
>Created the necessary computer algorithm to solve the connect four puzzle (almost finished), when it comes to figuring out who won the game
>going to need to figure out how to detect the winner diagonally, which is the true test for sure.

## Version 1.1.2 
>Minor tweaks to algorithm, getting rid of unneccessary over engineered code.

## Version 1.1.5
> Bug in algorithm needed to be fixed (fixed)
## Version 2.1.5
# Algorithm Complete
> Diagonal win 'solved' must stress test for future bugs, this was a fun project, however not so proud of my code, going to have to trim down in the future and make it more efficient 
# Algorithm update
> Im embarrased by the fact that I even wrote that code.... Algo has a time complexity of O(n^2), significantly less lines of code like that matters lol. anyway the game looks much cleaner
> Looking into learning machine learning will add an A.I to play against next update
